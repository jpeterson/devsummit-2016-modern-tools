_Joshua Peterson, Gavin Rehkemper, Esri_

The next generation of JS development is within reach. With the tools and resources available today, you can start writing code in ES2015 and beyond. Using Babel along with a modern module bundler like Webpack or Browserify, we’ll explore the ways you can leverage the latest features of JavaScript while streamlining your design-to-deploy cycle. As an added bonus, we’ll also dive into ways TypeScript can give you an additional level of control over your code.
